# Geography of Open Source Software

The goal of the project was to measure open source software contribution activity at a national, regional, and local level using data from GitHub and adjacent platforms. This data is used to better understand how open source interacts with the rest of the economy, for instance as a complement or substitute for proprietary work.



## Data Collection

The data collection scripts are written in Python and calls the APIs of the services Github, Twitter and Bing Maps.

The code was implemented in Python 3 and tested on a Linux machine. The required dependencies for the scripts are: tweepy, urllib, github, nuts_finder and pandas.
